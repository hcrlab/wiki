We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install Node.js.
To do so, find the [install script](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) in their README and run it.

Example:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Next, install the latest version of Node:
```
nvm install node
```

You should now have Node installed, check by running:
```
node -v
```
